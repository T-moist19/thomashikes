    <h2>Trail Journal</h2>
    <p>My personal reflections and water notes from each section of the Tahoe Rim Trail:</p>

    <article>
      <h3>1. Tahoe City to Brockway Summit (20.5 miles)</h3>
      <p>This first stretch was a gentle introduction to the TRT. I wound through shady pine forests and sunny hillsides filled with manzanita and low shrubs. The ancient lava formations around Watson Lake were wild to see — like hiking through prehistoric sculptures. Water was scarce after Watson Lake, so I made sure to fill up there. The lake was calm and quiet, a perfect spot for a mid-morning break.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>2. Brockway Summit to Mt. Rose / Tahoe Meadows (20.2 miles)</h3>
      <p>Climbing up to Relay Peak was tough but worth it — the views stretched for miles, and I passed through slopes bursting with wildflowers, even in mid-summer. Streams around Galena Falls were flowing strong and icy cold, great for a quick refill and foot soak. This was one of my favorite days for both scenery and water availability.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>3. Mt. Rose / Tahoe Meadows to Spooner Summit (24.1 miles)</h3>
      <p>This segment started with the lush, marshy Tahoe Meadows. I saw purple elephant’s head flowers blooming near muddy pools — surreal and beautiful. There were a few small streams in the first half of this segment, but they got patchier toward Spooner. I relied on a couple slow trickles and did a lot of filtering. This part really felt remote and peaceful.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>4. Spooner Summit to Kingsbury Grade (19 miles)</h3>
      <p>The trail skirted along the eastern rim, with some of the clearest views of Lake Tahoe so far. Genoa Peak towered nearby, and the light off the water was unreal in the morning. Water was limited on this leg — I carried extra from Spooner Lake, and it was a good call. A few seasonal creeks were dry, so I had to stretch my supply.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>5. Kingsbury Grade to Big Meadow (22.9 miles)</h3>
      <p>This section felt like a highlight reel: high alpine terrain, Star Lake nestled below Freel Peak, and meadows full of blooms. Star Lake was a perfect place to camp — cold, clear, and quiet. There were a few creeks flowing between Freel Saddle and the meadow, so water wasn’t hard to find. Definitely one of the more stunning and well-watered segments.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>6. Big Meadow to Echo Lakes (18.3 miles)</h3>
      <p>This stretch had a beautiful mix of shaded forest, open alpine views, and lots of small lakes and ponds. I passed Round Lake, Dardanelles Lake, and Lake of the Woods — all good for filtering. Mosquitoes were rough in the wetter areas, but it was worth it for the constant water and scenery. The meadows here felt untouched and alive.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>7. Echo Lakes to Barker Pass (32.5 miles)</h3>
      <p>The longest section, and definitely one of the most dramatic. It weaves through Desolation Wilderness alongside granite peaks and countless alpine lakes. Aloha, Heather, Gilmore, and more — each one was crystal-clear and icy. I never had to worry about water here. The terrain was tough but incredible. It felt like hiking through a stone cathedral.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> This section goes through the Desolation Wilderness, and you need a <strong>wilderness permit</strong> to legally hike or camp in this area. Permits are free and can be picked up at the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit ranger station in South Lake Tahoe or filled out online. They do this for safety and conservation reasons — to manage visitor numbers, monitor backcountry impact, and make it easier to locate hikers in case of emergencies.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>8. Barker Pass to Tahoe City (16.4 miles)</h3>
      <p>This last leg was bittersweet — I didn’t want the trail to end. There were great views of the northern lake, and I passed some friendly day hikers near Ward Creek. Water was more limited here, especially in late summer. A few creeks ran low or dry, so I timed my stops carefully. Reaching Tahoe City felt like coming full circle. I sat by the Truckee River, boots off, just soaking it all in.</p>
